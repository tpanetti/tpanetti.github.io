            tpanetti.com was made on a weekend I was down with the flu, or the cold or something. I don't know... whatever the case,
            that makes November 3rd, 2017 it's birthday! I spent the rest of the weekend working on the website (along with
            playing PUBG). The programming was very straightforward, sadly my lack of an eye for design was the most difficult
            part. I mainly created the website to challenge myself to make something somewhat visually pleasing, to have
            a place to air my thoughts (my prose was getting lousy), and to have a place to share my creative works.

            tpanetti.com is a very very simple website. I bought the domain name through google-domains, and picked the cheapest hosting option (free!) which was 
            github pages. This is where the magic of application routing comes in. You see, github pages only allows for serving a single page, but thanks to the wonders
            of the <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer Library</a>, what you are viewing now is a single page! The page routing is all done in javascript,
            throught a component called <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/app-route">app-route</a> mixed with <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/iron-pages">
            iron-pages</a>. While single page applications with this routing is not anything new, I still find it fascinating and one of the coolest parts of this website.
